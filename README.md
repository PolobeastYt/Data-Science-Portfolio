# Data-Science-Portfolio

Hi! I'm Jamie Leeuw, and I'm currently learning Python for Data Science.  
This repository will showcase my progress as I work on beginner-friendly projects involving data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.


This repository contains beginner-friendly Python projects I created while learning the foundations of data science.

## Goals
- Practice data cleaning and exploration with Pandas
- Build data visualizations using Matplotlib
- Work with real-world datasets
- Improve problem-solving skills with Python

## Upcoming Projects
1. **Titanic Data Analysis** – Survival rates by gender and passenger class (Coming Soon)
2. **Job Skills Analysis** – Top in-demand skills from job postings (Coming Soon)
3. **Global CO₂ Emissions** – Trends over time and top contributing countries (Coming Soon)
4. **COVID-19 Trends** – Cases and vaccination rates by country (Coming Soon)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

**Note:** This portfolio is a work in progress as I continue my journey to becoming a data scientist.
